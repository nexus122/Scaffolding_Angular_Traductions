# Scaffolding_Angular_Traductions

## ‍🎨 Angular material + Bluma
Para facilitar el diseño he obtado por tener dos frameworks.
- [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io/)
- [Bluma](https://bulma.io/)

### Angular Material
This library allows me to build a website following Material Design.
By loading only the elements I need I get a performance improvement.
There is quite a generous library of components that I can access.

### Bluma
Bluma is a css library that gives me multiple css selectors that allow me to create in a simple way a responsive page.
Being able to resize texts and elements according to the size of the screen.
